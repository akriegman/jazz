# Jazz 

Jazz is a program that intercepts your keybaord inputs before they reach any other program and turns certain combinations of keys into other keys. In this way you can input any symbol you need with minimal relearning and without moving your hands very far. It's kind of like Vim but much simpler, and works on top of every application on your computer.
